We'll assume that the input is a graph represented as an adjacency list and a starting node from which to begin the search. The DFS will be performed iteratively using a stack.\n",

       "### Step-by-Step Outline\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Import Necessary Modules**: \n",
       "   - You may need to import any necessary modules, but for a basic DFS, the standard library is sufficient.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Define the DFS Function**:\n",
       "   - Create a function named `dfs` that accepts two parameters: `graph` (a dictionary representing the adjacency list) and `start_node` (the node from which to start the search).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Initialize the Stack**:\n",
       "   - Create a stack (using a list) and push the `start_node` onto it.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Initialize a Set for Visited Nodes**:\n",
       "   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **While Loop for Iterative DFS**:\n",
       "   - Use a while loop that continues until the stack is empty.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Pop Node from Stack**:\n",
       "   - In each iteration of the loop, pop a node from the stack.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Check if Node has been Visited**:\n",
       "   - If the node has not been visited, do the following:\n",
       "     - Mark it as visited by adding it to the visited set.\n",
       "     - Process the node (this could be printing it or adding it to a result list).\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Push Neighbors onto Stack**:\n",
       "   - For each unvisited neighbor of the current node (from the graph), push it onto the stack.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Return or Print the Result**:\n",
       "   - After the loop, return or print the list of visited nodes if desired.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Example Usage**:\n",
       "    - Create a sample graph and call the `dfs` function with a starting node.\n",
