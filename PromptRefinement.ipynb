    "- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts.\n",
    "- Egg-free: No eggs or products containing eggs.\n",
    "- Low-sodium: Limited salt and naturally high-sodium ingredients.\n",
    "- Keto: Very low carbohydrate, high fat, moderate protein.\n",
    "- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods.\n",
    "- Kosher: Follows Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish, mixing meat and dairy, etc.).\n",

    "Guidelines for your analysis:\n",
    "- Mark a restriction as \"satisfied\" only if you are certain the recipe meets it.\n",
